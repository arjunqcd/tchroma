Installations for Building Chroma on a QCDOC
============================================

These build instructions were tested with QOS version:
/qcdoc/sfw/qos/devel/QMP_v2/qcdochost0

Once the QDP++ system is configured and installed
configuring Chroma on top of it is quite straightforward.
The only things need tripping are the cross-compilation as usual,
and whether or not to use the BAGEL Wilson Dslash.

The latter can be achieved by passing the flag:

	--enable-pab-wilson-dslash=noarch

to configure. The noarch is there as a placeholder when a single 
BAGEL dslash library may contain the code for several versions 
and is subject to suitable modification.

Also in this directory are two configure_chroma_xx.sh scripts
for building with and without the BAGEL Dslash. They rely on 
QDP++ installations (see the install notes in QDP++). The
way QDP++ is configured is that the include/link flags for
BAGEL are already specified in the QDP++ configuration so that
it can use the BLAS routines therein. Hence there is no
need to put those linkage flags into these configure_xxx.sh scripts
they are picked up automa(t|g)ically from the QDP++.

At present time, the assembler doesn't appear to work except
for purely local (NO_COMMS, or FAKE_COMMS) installations of BAGEL.
This will change. For the moment we recommend using the build
without the BAGEL dslash. Its slow but safe.
Your mileage may vary. Please contact me: bj@ph.ed.ac.uk for help.
